# Security Testing Checklist

## 1. Authentication Testing
- [ ] Verify user credentials are transmitted securely (e.g., using HTTPS).
- [ ] Ensure strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
- [ ] Test multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms.
- [ ] Validate account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
- [ ] Check for secure password reset and recovery processes.

## 2. Authorization Testing
- [ ] Verify role-based access controls (RBAC) are implemented correctly.
- [ ] Ensure users can only access resources for which they have permissions.
- [ ] Test horizontal and vertical privilege escalation scenarios.
- [ ] Check access control policies for sensitive data and functions.
- [ ] Validate that administrative functions are restricted to authorized users.

## 3. Session Management
- [ ] Ensure session IDs are unique, random, and securely generated.
- [ ] Verify sessions are properly terminated after logout.
- [ ] Test session expiration and idle timeout functionality.
- [ ] Check for secure handling of session cookies (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure flags).
- [ ] Validate that session fixation attacks are mitigated.

## 4. Data Protection
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- [ ] Verify proper use of cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.
- [ ] Test for secure storage of passwords (e.g., hashing with salt).
- [ ] Check for data leakage through logs, error messages, and debug information.
- [ ] Validate that sensitive data is masked or encrypted in the UI.

## 5. Input Validation
- [ ] Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Check for cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Validate input fields for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Ensure proper validation and sanitization of user inputs.
- [ ] Verify protection against command injection attacks.

## 6. Output Encoding
- [ ] Ensure data output is properly encoded to prevent XSS attacks.
- [ ] Verify that HTML, JavaScript, and other outputs are correctly escaped.
- [ ] Check for secure handling of user-generated content.
- [ ] Validate that output encoding is applied consistently across the application.
- [ ] Test for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protections.

## 7. Error Handling
- [ ] Ensure detailed error messages are not exposed to end users.
- [ ] Verify that error handling mechanisms do not leak sensitive information.
- [ ] Test for secure logging practices (e.g., no sensitive data in logs).
- [ ] Check that error responses do not reveal system or framework details.
- [ ] Validate proper handling of exceptions and error conditions.

## 8. Security Configuration
- [ ] Verify secure server and application configurations (e.g., disabling unnecessary services).
- [ ] Ensure secure configuration of web and application servers.
- [ ] Check for proper implementation of security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Content-Type-Options).
- [ ] Validate that third-party libraries and frameworks are up-to-date and secure.
- [ ] Test for secure configuration of databases and other backend systems.

## 9. Network Security
- [ ] Verify firewalls and network segmentation are properly configured.
- [ ] Ensure secure communication channels (e.g., VPN, TLS).
- [ ] Test for open ports and services that should be closed.
- [ ] Validate protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- [ ] Check for secure configuration of network devices (e.g., routers, switches).

## 10. Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Ensure security events are logged and monitored.
- [ ] Verify implementation of intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
- [ ] Check for alerts and notifications for suspicious activities.
- [ ] Validate that logs are protected from tampering and unauthorized access.
- [ ] Test log retention and analysis procedures.

## Notes
- Customize the checklist based on the specific needs of your project.
- Regularly review and update the checklist to address new security threats.
- Conduct thorough and continuous security testing to ensure robust protection.
